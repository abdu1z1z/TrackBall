‚öΩ Football Match Ball Possession Analysis Using Deep Learning üìä
This project provides an intelligent solution for analyzing ball possession during football matches using advanced deep learning techniques. The system leverages YOLO for object detection and DeepSORT for object tracking, combined with Kalman Filter to ensure accurate tracking even in challenging scenarios. The goal is to offer real-time insights into which team has more control over the ball during the match.

üìë Overview
Modern football analysis relies on data to understand team strategies and player performance. This project offers a detailed analysis of ball possession, providing valuable insights into how teams control the ball during matches. By employing machine learning techniques, we ensure accurate, consistent, and efficient data processing.

‚ú® Features
Real-Time Object Detection: Efficiently detects and identifies players, the ball, referees, and goalkeepers from video footage.
Object Tracking with DeepSORT: Accurately tracks player movements and ball positions across multiple frames, providing a clear understanding of the flow of the game.
Ball Possession Calculation: Determines which team has control over the ball and calculates possession percentages, allowing teams to analyze their dominance during different phases of the match.
Interactive Web Interface: Users can easily upload match videos and view analysis results through an intuitive Streamlit interface.
üîß How It Works
Object Detection with YOLO:
The core of the system relies on YOLO, a popular deep learning model for object detection. YOLO can efficiently detect multiple objects within a single frame, identifying players, the ball, referees, and goalkeepers.
Object Tracking with DeepSORT:
After detection, DeepSORT is used to track these objects throughout the video. It assigns a unique ID to each detected player or ball, allowing the system to follow their movements accurately across frames.
Kalman Filter:
The Kalman Filter is employed to predict the ball's location when it is briefly obscured from view. This helps in maintaining continuous tracking even during moments when the ball is hidden by players.
Possession Analysis:
By continuously tracking the ball and calculating its proximity to players, the system determines which team has control over the ball. This allows teams to understand their dominance in the game.
üîç Benefits
Coaching and Strategy Development: Coaches can utilize the system to understand their team's strengths and weaknesses, develop strategies, and plan training sessions based on data-driven insights.
Real-Time Analysis: Offers a quick and efficient way to analyze match footage, helping teams make tactical decisions during live games.
Enhanced Viewer Experience: Fans and commentators can use this analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the game's dynamics, including which team is dominating the play at any given moment.
Objective Metrics: Unlike traditional analysis methods, this system offers objective, data-driven insights, reducing the reliance on subjective human judgment.
‚ú® Practical Applications
Team Performance Evaluation: By analyzing possession patterns, coaches can get a clear picture of how effectively their team controls the ball and distributes it on the field.
Tactical Adjustments: Coaches can use real-time data to make tactical adjustments during live matches, reacting quickly to changes in possession and player positioning.
üéØ Results
After processing a match video, the system provides:

A breakdown of ball possession percentages for each team.
Visuals of player movements and ball trajectories.
Overall game dynamics, including periods of dominance for each team.
